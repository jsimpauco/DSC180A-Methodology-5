## Prompts
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic is how oral and gut microbiomes can predict a person's chronological age. Essentially, the gut and oral microbiomes change with age, which is how they can be used to tell a person’s chronological age. I thought that human skin was a given to predict a person’s age, but I assumed that oral and gut microbiomes would not change overtime. It makes sense now as to why they would change, but it is still interesting to think about.  
  
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
I would like to investigate how microbiomes can be used to predict autism. I learned that if autism can be detected early on the better, so that the child be given the care and attention needed much earlier. I don't know if there is a link between microbiomes and autism, but I would love to find out and see if there is.  
  
**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would have liked to do more scripting in small batches rather than all at once. Currently, we are finshing everything in a notebook first then moving it to scripts. I would instead however, like to finish some things in a notebook, then move that to scripts and repeat the process until the project is done. This would make it so we are not running into a ton of scripting errors at the end of the project, but rather breaking it up into smaller pieces.  
  
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would like to learn more scripting tricks to help reduce the framework needed in the repository. Currently, there are a lot of files that some people may not be familiar with. I would however, like to simplify the repository so that anyone that can understand a bit of code can follow.  
I would also like to clean the data more as currently we are working with a dataset found online that is already mainly cleaned and ready to use. However, I feel like I would understand the data even more if I cleaned it myself, so even though the work would be a bit more rigorous, I feel it would lead to a better project overall.
